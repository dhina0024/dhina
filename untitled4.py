1) Python?
 Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum.
 It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.
 Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language
 because it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details.
 Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting, and is popular for Rapid Application Development
and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding.
